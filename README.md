# Project Apricot

This project is the development of an enhanced skyblock minecraft server with a robust quest system, its own narrative and lore, custom items and weapons, as well as the capacity for community support. We are currently divided into 3 teams in order to work on this project as efficiently as possible and you can individually apply for any of the 3 teams. There will be collaboration between both team members and the other teams. Currently, we are building up membership for the project and are moving slowly, so right now there isn’t a definitive timeline. More below on Teams:
